## üß¨ **Algorithms Implemented**

1. **Gnome Sort**  
   - A simple sorting algorithm that works like the bubble sort but moves the element to its proper position in a single pass.

2. **Heap Sort**  
   - A comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure.

3. **Quick Sort**  
   - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts by partitioning an array into two sub-arrays.

4. **Radix Sort**  
   - A non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts numbers digit by digit.

5. **Bubble Sort**  
   - A basic comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
